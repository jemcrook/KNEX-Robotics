# KNEX-Robotics
This project contains all the neccesary files to experiment with advanced robotics using the Micro KNEX construction set. The actuators used are Feetech RC Serial Bus Servos (SCS0009) but most 9g hobby servos can be used in their place.

The Interface Board used for this project is the Waveshare Bus Servo Adapter:- https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Bus_Servo_Adapter_(A)
